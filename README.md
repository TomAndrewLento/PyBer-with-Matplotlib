# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Analysis
### Provide an analysis for V.Isualize demonstrating ridesharing data at PyBer.  First, I present a summary DataFrame as an overview of the data by city type.  Then, I create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, I submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

## Summary
### Recommendations
	* There is a total of 59,602 drivers in Urban settings, but a total fare of only $39,854.38 from 1625 rides.  Urban settings would do better with significantly fewer cab drivers
	* There were 8,570 drivers in suburban settings, but only 625 rides.  If there were 10x fewer cab drivers in the suburbs, there would still be more drivers than rides.
	* There were 537 drivers in a rural setting and only 125 rides, again there are more drivers than needed in a rural setting
